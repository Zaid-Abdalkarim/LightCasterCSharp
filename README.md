# LightCasterCSharp
This is a Light Caster for unity. It is a bit buggy and I cant think of any way of fixing it. It works well enough for me so I am just keeping it. 

To Use:

You will need to have a polygon collider on all objects that you want to be affected by the script. You can adjust the other settings like
how long you want the casts to be amongst other things.

If you think you can fix any bugs please let me know.
